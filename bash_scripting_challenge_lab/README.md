# üîê IAM Automation with Bash on Linux

## LAB OVERVIEW

This lab demonstrates how to **automate Identity and Access Management (IAM)** tasks on a Linux system using a Bash script. The lab simulates a real-world system administrator task of provisioning multiple users and groups with strong security practices.

### üéØ Objectives

- Automate creation of users and groups from a CSV file.
- Assign full names and group memberships.
- Apply password policies and enforce password reset on first login.
- Secure home directories with strict permissions.
- Log all actions to a file.
- Send user email notifications and enforce password complexity rules.

---

## ENVIRONMENT DETAILS

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or any modern Debian-based Linux)
- **Execution Mode**: Root or sudo privileges required
- **Tools Used**:
  - `bash` (scripting)
  - `useradd`, `groupadd`, `chage`, `passwd`, `chmod`, `mail`
  - `mailutils` for email 

---

## INPUT FILE FORMAT (`users.txt | users.csv`)

The script expects a `.csv` or `.txt` file (named `users.txt`, `users.csv` or custom) with the following format:
  - username,fullname,group


This format ensures automation is done without user input during execution.

## SCRIPT EXPLANATION (`iam_setup.sh`)

### Key Functionalities:

| Functionality              | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Group creation            | Creates group if it doesn‚Äôt exist |
| User creation             | Adds user with home directory and full name |
| Group assignment          | Assigns users to specified groups |
| Password setup            | Sets a temporary password (`ChangeMe123`) |
| Password policy           | Checks for complexity and enforces reset |
| Permission settings       | Home directories set to `chmod 700` |
| Logging                   | All actions written to `iam_setup.log` |
| CSV input support         | Accepts CSV file as command-line argument |
| Email notification        | Sends email to user after creation (if `mailutils` installed) |

## üìù RUNNING THE SCRIPT

### 1. Make Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x iam_setup.sh
```
### 2. Install Optional Mail Dependency
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mailutils -y
```

### 3. Execute the Script
```bash
sudo ./iam_setup.sh users.txt
```
